webp-hero — [live demo](https://chase-moskal.github.io/webp-hero/)
=========


browser polyfill for the webp image format
------------------------------------------

- `npm install webp-hero`

simply add [webp-hero.polyfill.bundle.js](./dist/webp-hero.polyfill.bundle.js) to your html page, and your webp images come alive in firefox, safari, edge, internet explorer, and of course, chrome

webp-hero actually runs google's `libwebp` decoder in the browser — it converts webp images to png's on-the-fly

the polyfill renders the decoded image data to a hidden canvas, and converts that to a png data url which is then displayed to the user

this pushes the burden off your bandwidth expense, and onto your user's processor (running the decoder instead of serving up fat images)


features
--------

- [**webp-hero.polyfill.bundle.js**](./dist/webp-hero.polyfill.bundle.js)
	- just run that script on your html page
	- it will decode your page's webp images (currently only img tags)
	- the functionality is directly available with the `"webp-hero"` common-js module [webp-hero.polyfill.js](./source/webp-hero.polyfill.ts)

- [**dwebp.js**](./dist/dwebp.js)
	- this is compiled from google's `libwebp` emscripten build, and then wrapped in a common-js module
	- contains minimal functionality for rendering webp data to a canvas — no polyfilling logic
	- available as common-js module via `"webp-hero/dist/dwebp"`
	- see the typescript declaration file, [dwebp.d.ts](./source/dwebp.d.ts), which describes its usage signature


development
-----------

- **prerequisites**
	- git
	- node
	- docker (if you want to rebuild libwebpjs)

- **build libwebpjs** *(not necessary)*
	- `./libwebpjs-build.sh` — use admin privileges (docker requires this)
	- it runs the docker build of libwebp (takes a long time)
	- it writes build artifacts to `dist/`
	- `./libwebpjs-debug.sh` — useful to drop into the container to have a look around

- **development based on top of libwebpjs**
	- `npm install` — install dependencies and run build
	- `npm start` — start http server
	- visit http://localhost:8080/ to see google's web demo
