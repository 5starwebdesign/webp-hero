webp-hero
=========

browser polyfill for the webp image format
------------------------------------------

- webp images come alive! in firefox, safari, edge, internet explorer, and chrome
- webp-hero actually runs google's `libwebp` decoder in the browser — it converts webp images to png's on-the-fly
- webp-hero's polyfill functionality renders decoded image data to a hidden canvas, and converts that to a png data url which is then displayed to the user

### live demo

- [webp-hero/](https://chasemoskal.com/webp-hero/?force) — webp-hero polyfill operating normally (does nothing if your browser supports webp)
- [webp-hero/?force](https://chasemoskal.com/webp-hero/?force) — webp conversion to png is forced (even if your browser supports webp)

### freshness

how to use webp-hero's polyfill on your page
--------------------------------------------

- webp-hero contains a class called `WebpMachine` which has a `polyfillDocument` method which converts webp images into png's
- currently, the polyfill only works on img tags (not yet on css images)

### use webp-hero in a simple html page

1. load the webp-hero bundle onto the page (you may want the polyfills too)

	```html
	<script src="webp-hero/dist/polyfills.js"></script>
	<script src="webp-hero/dist/webp-hero.bundle.js"></script>
	```

2. run the webp-hero polyfill function

	```html
	<script>
		var webpMachine = new webphero.WebpMachine()
		webpMachine.polyfillDocument()
	</script>
	```

### use webp-hero in a commonjs application

1. install the webp-hero npm package

	`npm install webp-hero`

2. import and run the webp-hero polyfill function

	```js
	import {WebpMachine} from "webp-hero"
	const webpMachine = new WebpMachine()
	webpMachine.polyfillDocument()
	```

### advanced usage

- the webp-machine class also has a `polyfillImage` and also a `decode` method if you want more fine-grained control (see [webp-machine.ts](./source/webp-machine.ts) source for more info)

direct usage of webp commonjs module
------------------------------------

- the webp-machine has polyfilling and caching logic, but you can use google's webp functionality more directly via `webp-hero/libwebp/dist/webp.js`
	- this is compiled from google's `libwebp` emscripten build inside a docker container
	- it is then wrapped in a common-js module
	- it contains minimal functionality for rendering webp data to a canvas
	- the typescript declaration file describes the usage signature: [webp.d.ts](./libwebp/source/webp.d.ts)

development on webp-hero
------------------------

- **prerequisites**
	- git
	- node
	- docker (only if you want to rebuild libwebp)

- **development**
	- `npm install` — install dependencies and run build
		- run typescript build
		- generates `webp-hero/dist/webo-hero.bundle.js`
	- `npm start` — start http server
		- visit http://localhost:8080/ to see the webp-hero demo
		- visit http://localhost:8080/libwebp/dist/google/ to see google's demo

- **rebuild libwebp**
	- google's libwebp project is built inside of a docker container
	- libwebp build artifacts (in `libwebp/dist`) are checked into git, because it takes so long to build
	- `sudo ./libwebp/build` — run the libwebp build (docker requires sudo)
	- `sudo ./libwebp/debug` — useful to drop into the container to have a look around, does not any emit build artifacts'
